# StudentGen project - Reflection

1. What did you like about this project?

   I liked that this project really put my understanding of composition, inheritance and interface classes to the test. Without proper understanding, there is no way to draw the relationship between these classes and make use of them to come up with the solution.
   
2. What did you struggle with in this project?

   A good amount of time was spent on trying to understand what the classes are and how they relate to each other. From there, I had to further look into the default attributes and methods that have been created. Following that, I still had to think of whether new attributes and methods are required before even starting to work on the code. It was a long process and really challenging.
   
3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?

   While more guidance would make the assessment easier and less mind boggling, it would defeat its primary purpose. I am glad that I had the opportunity to solve this assessment which thoroughly tested my understanding of Java concepts.
